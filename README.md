# Predicting-Survey-Responses-using-Textual-Data-from-Social-Media-with-MetaBERT

This code repository is related to the paper *Transforming Social Media Text into Predictive tools for depression through AI: a test-case study on the Beck Depression Inventory-II* by Ravenda et al. <br><br>

This work is based on a workflow pipeline that utilizes a retrieval system to find the most relevant Reddit posts for each item of the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and a model, known as MetaBERT, capable of predicting the scores associated with each user.
